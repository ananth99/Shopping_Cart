# Lemmywinks Bot for Lemmy Reddevils

## Overview

After the unceremonious actions over at Reddit, this is a bot to help moderate the subreddit. The bot is hosted on a website meant for discord bots. This is due to its small size and those websites allow websockets, which the API relies on to get mentions etc.

This is quite primitave right now. The list of planned features are as follows. Anything that is checked is completed to a certain extent:

- [ ] Daily Discussion Posts & Free talk friday
- [ ] Match Threads
  - [ ] Live lineup support
  - [ ] Live Score
  - [ ] Text Match commentary
- [ ] Auto post journalist posts
- [ ] Auto report unreliable/bad posts
- [ ] Toxicity check
- [ ] Goal Bot

Lots of features, not a lot of time. But we will get through it.
